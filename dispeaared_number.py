# Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
#
#     Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
#
#     Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
#
#     Example:
#
#     Input:
#     [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
#
# Output:
#     [5,6]
